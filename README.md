|---Permissioned & Privacy Preserving Supply Chain Blockchain using Hyperledger Fabric---|

Undergraduate thesis-project at NIT Trichy under Dr. M. Brindha. The objective of this project was to enable a more nuanced blockchain architecture using Hyperledger Fabric, that would draw the best balance between traditional web technology and a public blockchain, including privacy protection and security. A preliminary analysis was performed, then the proposed system was formulated and implemented - Network, Chaincode SDK, Asset Definition, Rest API, and the Membership & Access Control which constituted the crucial security & privacy components i.e. TLS, PKI and Identity Mixer (ZKP). Finally an E2E performance evaluation was performed to strengthen the proof-of-concept.
