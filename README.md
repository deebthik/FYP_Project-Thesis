Undergraduate project-thesis at NIT Trichy under Dr. M. Brindha. The objective of this project was to identify whether permissioned blockchain platforms, such as Hyperledger Fabric, could help the stakeholders in the supply chain industry engage in a less-corruptible alternative to traditional web technology and whether they could enable a more positively nuanced blockchain system that draws the best balance between traditional web technology and a public blockchain, including privacy protection and security, also making the system more reliable, robust, modular, and trustworthy.
