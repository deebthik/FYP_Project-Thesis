|---Permissioned & Privacy Preserving Supply Chain Blockchain using Hyperledger Fabric---|

Undergraduate thesis-project at NIT Trichy under Dr. M. Brindha. The objective of this project was to enable a more nuanced blockchain architecture using Hyperledger Fabric, that would draw the best balance between traditional web technology and a public blockchain, including privacy protection and security. A preliminary analysis was performed, then the proposed system was formulated and implemented - Network, Chaincode SDK, Asset Definition, Rest API, and lastly the Membership & Access Control that comprised of the crucial security and privacy components such as PKI and Identity Mixer. Finally an E2E performance evaluation was performed to strengthen the proof-of-concept.
